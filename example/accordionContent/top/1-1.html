<p>Sir accordion is a highlighy customizable accordion menu. It loads content from a JSON array with a defined format, and can have as many levels or items as the developer wants.</p>
<p>The project consists in an angular directive wich feeds from an array and an optional config object.</p>
<p>JQuery is not required and the animations are made with VelocityJS.</p>
<p>The accordion is responsive, and when an item is expanded, the content's height is not fixed.</p>

<p>In the case where an item has a <code>bottomContent</code> and a <code>subcollection</code>, the content is going to be positioned bellow the collection.</p>
<p>Both the <code>topContent</code> and the <code>bottomContent</code> attributes are optional in each item an can coexist, meaning you can expand an item thas has a collection of items of its own, but can also have at the same time information on top and below this items.</p>
<p>For better organizing, if there is no need to add information bellow a <code>subCollection</code>, it's recommended to use only the <code>topContent</code>.
